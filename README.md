This repository contains a Python implementation for a genetic algorithm that finds Methuselah patterns in Conway's Game Of Life.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```console
   git clone https://github.com/shlomi-levi/Methuselah-Finder-Game-Of-Life.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the installation folder.
   
3. Edit 'genetic_algorithm_run_example.py' to suit your needs (you can edit the mutation function, recombination function and evaluation function)

4. Run 'genetic_algorithm_run_example.py'

5. The best Methuselah will be saved in a pickle file. You can run 'Simulation.py' to view his evolution in the game of life
